## Description
My grade 10 IT project had the topic "Maths for children". I created an application targeted at Grade 1-3 children that would help them practice their arithmetic in a "fun" way. The application lets the user choose an operation from "Addition", "Subtraction", "Multiplication" and "Division", the number of questions to answer correctly and the difficulty. They then get drilled and the time taken is recorded. They get an award depending on their time.

## Issues
If the program cannot find the record text files, copy the "src/records" folder, go into the "dist" folder and create a folder called "src", copy the "records" folder here.
